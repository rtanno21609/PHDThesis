\chapter{Conclusions} \label{chapter:conclusions}

In this thesis I presented my work on uncertainty modelling in deep learning and decisions trees as well as applications to various merdical imaging problems. In this chapter I will present a summary of the thesis, along with future research directions. 

\textcolor{red}{Yarin's thesis was only 3 pages!}
\textcolor{red}{Mackay's thesis is full of good thoughts. More work is called for on the relationship between the evidence, crossâ€“validation and generalisation ability to understand these results.}
