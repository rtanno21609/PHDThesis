\chapter{MPhil-to-PhD Transfer}
\label{chapterlabel1}

This is my first attempt at drafting this piece of formality \cite{example-citation}. 
\section{Problem statement}
Describe the research problem that your work is addressing (approx. 5-6 sentences)

\section{Literature Review} 
Details of any research literature you have reviewed and conclusions drawn

\section{Summary of the contribution} 
your PhD is intended to make to already existing literature on the topic

\section{Scope of the thesis}
state the boundaries of your research â€“ what will be included, what not?

\section{Research progress}
Activities (reviews, studies, experiments, simulations, etc.) that you have carried out, and their results. 

\section{Others}
In addition, it would be nice to have a summary of:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Activities you are planning to do to further your thesis/ your plan going forward.
	\item Any draft chapters for your final thesis you have already prepared
	\item Any publications you have submitted/ intend to submit to a conference or journal.
	\item Draft timetable 
\end{itemize}
