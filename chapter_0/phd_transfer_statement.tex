\section{Problem statement}
Deep learning and decisions trees are now ubiquitous in the field of medical image processing. However, the current methods disproportionately rely on deterministic algorithms, which lack a mechanism to represent and manipulate uncertainty about models and predictions. In safety-critical applications such as medical imaging, quantifying what the model does not know is critical for constructing a reliable decision making system. The aim of this thesis is to explore probabilitic modelling as a framework to integrate uncertainty information in deep learning and decision tree models, and demonstrate utility in various medical image processing applications.
