\chapter*{Abstract}
Deep learning is now ubiquitous in the research field of medical image computing. As such technologies progress towards clinical translation, the question of safety becomes critical. Once deployed, machine learning systems unavoidably face situations where the correct decision or prediction is ambiguous. However, the current methods disproportionately rely on deterministic algorithms, lacking a mechanism to represent and manipulate uncertainty. In safety-critical applications such as medical imaging, reasoning under uncertainty is crucial for developing a reliable decision making system. 

Probabilistic machine learning provides a natural framework to quantify the degree of uncertainty over different variables of interest, be it the prediction, the model parameters and structures, or the underlying data (images and labels). Probability distributions are used to represent all the uncertain unobserved quantities in a model and how they relate to the data, and probability theory is used as a language to compute and manipulate these distributions. In this thesis, we explore probabilistic modelling as a framework to integrate uncertainty information into deep learning models, and demonstrate its utility in various high-dimensional medical imaging applications. In the process, we make several fundamental enhancements to current methods. 

We categorise our contributions into three groups according to the types of uncertainties being modelled: (i) predictive; (ii) structural and (iii) human uncertainty. \textit{Firstly}, we discuss the importance of quantifying predictive uncertainty and understanding its sources for developing a risk-averse and transparent medical image enhancement application. We demonstrate how a measure of predictive uncertainty can be used as a proxy for the predictive accuracy in the absence of ground-truths. Furthermore, assuming the structure of the model is flexible enough for the task, we introduce a way to decompose the predictive uncertainty into its orthogonal sources i.e. aleatoric and parameter uncertainty. We show the potential utility of such decoupling in providing a quantitative ``explanations'' into the model performance. \textit{Secondly}, we introduce our recent attempts at learning model structures directly from data. One work proposes a method based on variational inference to learn a posterior distribution over connectivity structures within a neural network architecture for multi-task learning, and share some preliminary results in the MR-only radiotherapy planning application. Another work explores how the training algorithm of decision trees could be extended to grow the architecture of a neural network to adapt to the given availability of data and the complexity of the task.  \textit{Lastly},  we develop methods to model the ``measurement noise'' (e.g., biases and skill levels) of human annotators, and integrate this information into the learning process of the neural network classifier. In particular, we show that explicitly modelling the uncertainty involved in the annotation process not only leads to an improvement in robustness to label noise, but also yields useful insights into the patterns of errors that characterise individual experts. 


%Deep learning is now ubiquitous in the field of medical image computing. However, the current methods disproportionately rely on deterministic algorithms, which lack a mechanism to represent and manipulate uncertainty about models and predictions. In safety-critical applications such as medical imaging, quantifying what the model does not know is crucial for developing a reliable decision making system. 
%
%In this talk, I would like to give an overview of my past research and the future outlook, focusing on the methods for modelling (i) predictive, (ii) structural and (iii) human uncertainty. Firstly, I will discuss the importance of quantifying predictive uncertainty and understanding its sources for developing a risk-averse and transparent medical image enhancement application. Secondly, I will talk about our recent attempt at learning useful connectivity structures within a CNN model for multi-task learning, and share some preliminary results in the MR-only radiotherapy planning application. Lastly, I will present our recent work on modelling the uncertainty of multiple human annotators, and thereby learning efficiently in the presence of large label noise and disagreement, a pervasive issue in medical imaging datasets in practice. 

%provides a natural framework to quantify the degree of uncertainty over different variables of interest, be it the prediction, the model parameters and structures, or the underlying data (images and labels) \cite{ghahramani2015probabilistic}.  The main goal of this thesis is to develop a practical framework for medical imaging applications to model and reason with different types of uncertainty in deep learning models by translating ideas from the paradigm of probabilistic machine learning. In the process, several fundamental enhancements to current methods arise. 


% Should contain summaries of the three main components of the project, an individual paragraph to each: (a) why you did the work and what you were trying to achieve; (b) what methods you used and what results obtained; and (c) what you concluded from it. 

%\paragraph{Problem statement}
%Deep learning and decisions trees are now ubiquitous in the field of medical image processing. However, the current methods disproportionately rely on deterministic algorithms, which lack a mechanism to represent and manipulate uncertainty about models and predictions. In safety-critical applications such as medical imaging, quantifying what the model does not know is important for constructing a reliable decision making system. The aim of this thesis is to explore probabilitic modelling as a framework to integrate uncertainty information in deep learning and decision tree models, and demonstrate utility in various medical image processing applications. 
%
%\paragraph{Scope}
%The thesis primarily focuses on both the development of new techniques for accounting for uncertainty information in deep learning and decision trees, and demonstrating their practical values in medical imaging applications. 

%In order to find effective treatments for Alzheimer's disease (AD), a devastating neurodegenerative disease affecting millions of people worldwide, we need to identify subjects at risk of AD as early as possible. To this end, disease progression models have been recently developed, which not only to perform early diagnosis, but also estimate a unique disease signature that is used to predict the subjects' disease stages and future evolution. However, these models have not yet been applied to rare neurodegenerative diseases, are not suitable to understand the complex dynamics of biomarkers, work only on large multimodal datasets, and their predictive performance has not been objectively validated.
%
%In this work I developed novel models of disease progression and applied them to estimate the progression of Alzheimer's disease and Posterior Cortical atrophy, a rare neurodegenerative syndrome causing visual deficits. My first contribution is a study on the progression of Posterior Cortical Atrophy, using models already developed: the Event-based Model (EBM) and the Differential Equation Model (DEM). My second contribution is the development of DIVE, a novel spatio-temporal model of disease progression that estimates fine-grained spatial patterns of pathology, potentially enabling us to understand complex disease mechanisms relating to pathology propagation along brain networks. My third contribution is the development of Disease Knowledge Transfer (DKT), a novel disease progression model that estimates the multimodal progression of rare neurodegenerative diseases from limited, unimodal datasets, by transferring information from larger, multimodal datasets of typical neurodegenerative diseases. My fourth contribution is the development of novel extensions for the EBM and the DEM, and the development of novel measures for performance evaluation of such models. My last contribution is the organization of the TADPOLE challenge, a competition which aims to identify algorithms and features that best predict the evolution of AD. 

\chapter*{Impact Statement}
This thesis introduces new algorithms for modelling different types of uncertainty in deep learning models and explores utility thereof in high-dimensional, challenging medical imaging applications where safety is critical. We have demonstrated that appropriate modelling of uncertainty not only improves the predictive performance of the machine learning model in an array of settings (e.g., within-distribution and out-of-distribution generalisation, presence of outliers/noisy labels in the training data, scenarios in which multiple tasks are jointly learned, etc), but also enables quantification of risks associated with the prediction, which can be used to manage the safety of downstream decision-making.  While most of the algorithmic advances were motivated by specific medical applications, the resultant solutions are general and thus their applicability extends to other problems in medical imaging and beyond (e.g., computer vision). 

%\thispagestyle{empty}

%The work presented in this thesis furthers our understanding of the temporal evolution of Posterior Cortical Atrophy and Alzheimer's disease. The disease progression models and evaluation techniques that we developed can help towards understanding underlying disease mechanisms, aid patient stratification and drug evaluation in clinical trials for Alzheimer's disease and Posterior Cortical Atrophy, and can be used in clinical practice for predicting the future evolution of subjects that are at risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. 
%
%I published the work in this PhD thesis in two first-author papers (DIVE and TADPOLE chapters), and will soon submit another two papers (DKT and PCA chapters). I have also communicated my results in international conferences. I have also engaged with the broader scientific community by organising the TADPOLE Challenge, as well as a couple of hackathons at the PyConUK conference and the CMIC Summer School.

\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
First, I would like to thank my supervisors, Daniel Alexander and Antonio Criminisi, for their support and encouragement. Danny gave my mind substantial room to explore and grow as an independent researcher while he kept me on track and stepped in to help when most needed. He has been extremely helpful in positioning, brainstorming and iterating many research ideas. I am also thankful to him for creating such a friendly, open and collaborative culture in Centre for Medical Image Computing at UCL. While my time spent with Antonio was more limited partly due to a geographic reason, every time we spoke, I was inspired by his deep insights. His textbook was, in fact, what lead me to take an interest in machine learning and its applications to medical imaging, and start a PhD in the very subject (with him!). It has been a pleasure being able to work with two exemplary researchers who have spent many years thinking deeply not only about the models and algorithms, but also the ways in which to transform positively the healthcare domain through such innovations. 

During my doctorate, I have also been fortunate to learn from many mentors from diverse backgrounds. I would like to thank Aditya Nori and other folks in InnerEye for making me feel at home at Microsoft Research Cambridge. His enthusiasm, broad perspective and constant encouragement made the project very rewarding, which undoubtedly made me want to return (which I did). Nathan Silverman at Butterfly Network in NY has taught me the critical role of software engineering both in conducting fundamental research and translating them into practice; it was eye-opening to witness that one is able to design a development environment in which half-baked prototypical ideas could be immediately tested on a real piece of hard-ware. Finally, I would like to thank Jorge Cardoso at King's College London for being open-minded and letting me be involved in many exciting collaborations. His creativity and bottomless energy constantly reminded me of how exciting research could be. 

I would like to thank a number of colleagues and friends who I was fortunate to learn from and collaborate with to produce the research presented in this thesis. In no particular order:  Daniel Worrall, Aurobrata Ghosh, Enrico Kaden, Felix Bragman, Kai Arulkumaran, Sven Ardavan Saeedi, Swami Sankaranarayanan, Kin Quan,  Konstantinos Kamnitsas, Moucheng Xu, Chen Jin, Le Zhang. All the midnight oil we burned together during the deadline death-marches will be kept forever as a fond memory. 

I would like to thank my family in Japan for their selfless support and love. Last but not least, a big thank you to my wife, Maya Wright, for making this journey fun outside research, and for being an example to follow.
